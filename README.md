# 🎓 Smart Campus Operations Hub
IT3030 – Programming Applications and Frameworks (PAF) Assignment 2026

A full-stack enterprise-style web application designed to manage facility bookings, asset management, and incident handling within a university environment.

# 📌 Project Overview

This system enables efficient campus operations through a centralized platform that supports:

Resource (facility & equipment) management
Booking workflows with approval processes
Maintenance and incident ticketing
Real-time notifications
Role-based secure access

The system is implemented using a Spring Boot REST API and a React client application, following modern software engineering practices and layered architecture.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

Frontend: React-based responsive web UI
Backend: Spring Boot REST API (layered architecture)
Database: MongoDB / MySQL (based on implementation)
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 (Google Sign-In)

# 🚀 Core Modules
###🏢 Module A – Facilities & Assets Catalogue
Manage resources (rooms, labs, equipment)
Resource metadata: type, capacity, location, availability, status
Search and filter functionality

## 📅 Module B – Booking Management
Request resource bookings
Booking workflow:
PENDING → APPROVED / REJECTED → CANCELLED
Conflict detection for overlapping bookings
Admin approval/rejection with reason
User-specific and admin-wide booking views

## 🛠️ Module C – Maintenance & Incident Ticketing
Create incident tickets with priority and category
Upload image attachments (max 3)
Ticket lifecycle:
OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED / REJECTED
Technician assignment and resolution updates
Comment system with ownership control

## 🔔 Module D – Notifications
Booking status updates
Ticket updates and comments
Accessible notification panel in UI

## 🔐 Module E – Authentication & Authorization
OAuth 2.0 (Google login)
Role-based access control (RBAC):
USER
ADMIN
(Optional: TECHNICIAN)
Secured API endpoints and protected routes
